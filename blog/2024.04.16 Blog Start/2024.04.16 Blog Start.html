        <h2>Blog: Start!</h2>
        <p>Hello!
            <br>
            <br>
            This is just a lil introductory post to whatever this site is. Like many others online, I've grown increasingly disillusioned with the state of the internet and its perpetual enshittification.
            <br>
            <br>
            So, inspired by my pal <a href="https://nathanwentworth.co" target="_blank">Nathan</a> and his personal site, I've decided to carve out a little space on the web to call my own, away from all the Likes and Reposts and the ever-present specter of The Algorithm... despite having zero webdev experience.
            <br>
            <br>            
            Armed with a bit of resolve and a one-week free trial to Codecademy, I've stuffed my brain with just enough HTML, CSS, and GitHub know-how to throw this together.
        </p>

        <p>
          And here we are! As barebones as a site can be!
          <br>
          <br>
          I'm sure this will very much be a perpetual work-in-progress as I continue to add, reorganize, and improve upon this site as I go on and learn more, but it's already nice to be able to put this together totally from scratch!
          <br>
          <br>
          Now to put it to good use...
